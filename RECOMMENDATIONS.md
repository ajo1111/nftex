# NFT Marketplace Development Recommendations

## Production Deployment Checklist

### 1. Environment Variables
- [ ] Set up proper environment variables for production
- [ ] Never commit sensitive values to repository
- [ ] Use `.env.production` for production-specific variables
- [ ] Document all required environment variables

### 2. Error Monitoring & Logging
- [ ] Implement error monitoring (e.g., Sentry)
- [ ] Set up proper logging system
- [ ] Configure error boundaries for React components
- [ ] Implement proper error pages (404, 500)

### 3. Performance Optimization
- [ ] Configure CDN for static assets
- [ ] Implement proper cache headers
- [ ] Optimize image loading and formats
- [ ] Consider implementing lazy loading for components
- [ ] Monitor and optimize bundle size

### 4. SEO & Metadata
- [ ] Add meta tags to all pages
- [ ] Implement sitemap.xml
- [ ] Add robots.txt
- [ ] Ensure proper Open Graph tags for social sharing
- [ ] Implement structured data for NFTs

### 5. Security
- [ ] Regular security audits
- [ ] Implement rate limiting
- [ ] Set up proper CORS policies
- [ ] Regular dependency updates
- [ ] Implement proper authentication flows

### 6. Analytics & Monitoring
- [ ] Set up analytics (e.g., Google Analytics, Plausible)
- [ ] Implement proper privacy policies
- [ ] Set up performance monitoring
- [ ] Configure user behavior tracking

### 7. Testing
- [ ] Implement unit tests
- [ ] Add integration tests
- [ ] Set up end-to-end testing
- [ ] Configure CI/CD pipeline

### 8. Documentation
- [ ] Maintain API documentation
- [ ] Document deployment process
- [ ] Keep README up to date
- [ ] Document known issues and workarounds

## Best Practices

### Code Organization
- Keep components modular and reusable
- Follow consistent naming conventions
- Maintain proper file structure
- Use TypeScript for better type safety

### State Management
- Use appropriate state management solutions
- Implement proper data caching
- Handle loading and error states
- Implement proper data validation

### UI/UX
- Maintain consistent design system
- Ensure responsive design
- Implement proper loading states
- Add proper error handling UI
- Ensure accessibility compliance

### Performance
- Optimize images and assets
- Implement proper code splitting
- Use proper caching strategies
- Monitor and optimize API calls

## Deployment Notes
- Current configuration uses static export
- Images are configured for unoptimized export
- Security headers are implemented
- Compression is enabled
- Strict mode is enabled for better development

## Future Considerations
- Consider implementing server-side rendering for dynamic routes
- Plan for scaling database and storage
- Consider implementing WebSocket for real-time features
- Plan for internationalization if needed
- Consider implementing PWA features

## Maintenance
- Regular dependency updates
- Monitor error logs
- Regular security audits
- Performance monitoring
- User feedback collection
